## Use Case 2: Config Sync Group

Config Sync Groups is a feature on NGINX One Console that allow us to group multiple NGINX instances and leverage an
identical configuration across all instances. This feature is extremely helpful in ephemeral environments, such as
Docker and Kubernetes, as the NGINX instance can pull its configuration versus needing to rebuild the NGINX container
every time the configuration changes. This section will go through using this feature.

The system diagram showing this interaction can be seen below.

## Introduction

After this lab, you will be able to:

- Add NGINX Instances to a config sync group
- Manage and update NGINX configurations for multiple NGINX instance via Config Sync Group
- View logs

## Demo lab

Watch me go through a demo where I will be using the Config Sync Group.

## Next up

Let's proceed to the [Interactive Lab](nginx-one-9.mdx).
