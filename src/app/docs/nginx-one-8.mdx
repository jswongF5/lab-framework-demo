## Use Case 2: Config Sync Group

Config Sync Groups allow us to group multiple NGINX instances and leverage an identical configuration across all
instances. This feature is extremely helpful in ephemeral environments, such as Docker and Kubernetes, as the NGINX
instance can pull its configuration versus needing to rebuild the NGINX container every time the configuration changes.
This section will go through using this feature.

The system diagram showing this interaction can be seen below.

## Introduction

After this lab, you will be able to:

- Add NGINX Instances to a config sync group
- Manage and update NGINX configurations for multiple NGINX instance via Config Sync Group
- View logs

## Demo lab

I will now do a demo lab. The instructions I am going though is here. You can watch me go thought the demo or follow
along with me. I will be going [here](nginx-one-2.mdx#config-sync-groups)

## Next up

Lets continue to the [Interactive Lab](nginx-one-9.mdx).
