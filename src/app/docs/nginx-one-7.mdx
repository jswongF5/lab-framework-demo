## Introduction

Welcome to the Fix It Lab. We will be trying to add an NGINX instance to NGINX One Console. A command will be provided
but you don't need to focus much on the command itself. The point of it is to get something in a broken state. And your
goal will be to look for evidence as to why it is in a broken state.

The **Lab Framework** from the UDF environment has **docker** installed and is setup so it can run an NGINX Plus
container image. We will be using this for this portion of this lab.

1. Open a Web Shell to the **Lab Framework** UDF system and start an NGINX Plus container with the commands below.

    ```shell
    docker run --hostname={{petname}}-nginx-plus-fixit --name={{petname}}-nginx-plus-fixit \
    --env=NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_GRPCPORT=443 \
    --env=NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_HOST=agent.connect.nginx.com \
    --env=NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_TOKEN=abc2jcK8Fm1yQItpXZv0zks1KKQUXmJzJMkjButWAOY= \
    --env=NGINX_AGENT_TLS_ENABLE=true \
    --env=NGINX_AGENT_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY=false \
    --restart=always \
    --runtime=runc \
    -d private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-plus/agent:debian
    ```

## Fix it

Someone from the deployment team is trying to add an NGINX instance to NGINX One Console. The person is using an NGINX
Plus container. The person thinks the command they copied looks correct. But after waiting hours, the instance still is
not showing up on the NGINX One Console.

You are being asked to take a look to find out why this NGINX instance isn't being added to the NGINX One Console and
fix it.

Use you troubleshooting knowledge to determine the root cause.

<Collapsible title="Solution">

Let's take a look at the NGINX agent logs. The logs can be examined by connecting to the container.

1. Start a Web Shell for the ***Lab Framework** system. You can view the logs by running the command below.

    ``` bash
    docker exec -it {{petname}}-nginx-plus-fixit more /var/log/nginx-agent/agent.log
    ```

1. Looking at the logs we see that there is authentication issue and the container is unable to communicate with
**agent.connect.nginx.com:443**.

    ![Container Logs](media/lab8-1.png)

    > Notice log messages with the word **Unauthenticated**.
    > ````shell
    > time="2024-09-17T22:47:39Z" level=error msg="Commander Channel Recv: error communicating with agent.connect.nginx.com:443, code=Unauthenticated, message=no autho
    > ````

    We now highly suspect the Data Plane Key. Let's try to re-create this instance but this time, let's use the one we
    created in this lab.

1. Delete the container and re-deploy with the data plane key you saved earlier.

    > **Note:** Use your existing data plane key if you still have a valid one, if not then generate a new one. 

    ```bash
    docker rm -f {{petname}}-nginx-plus-fixit
    ```

    ```bash
    sudo docker run --hostname={{petname}}-nginx-plus-fixit --name={{petname}}-nginx-plus-fixit \
    --env=NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_GRPCPORT=443 \
    --env=NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_HOST=agent.connect.nginx.com \
    --env=NGINX_AGENT_TLS_ENABLE=true \
    --env=NGINX_AGENT_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY=false \
    --restart=always \
    --runtime=runc \
    --env=NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_TOKEN=YOUR_DATA_PLANE_KEY \
    -d private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-plus/agent:debian
    ```

1.  Now let's go look at the agent logs to confirm if we still see the continual **Unauthenticated** lines.

    ``` bash
    docker exec -it {{petname}}-nginx-plus-fixit more /var/log/nginx-agent/agent.log
    ```

    ![Container Logs](media/lab8-2.png)

1. Great, so far the agent logs look okay. Now navigate back to NGINX One Console and look at the *Instances*. You
should now see your fixed instance here.

Great job! You now know the starting point when you need to troubleshoot your NGINX instance.

## Lab Cleanup

Time to clean up the resources you created in this lab. As a safety precaution, the NGINX One console will not allow
you to delete an instance that is online. We will first have to shut down the instances before deleting them from the
NGINX One Console.

1. For the Docker containers running NGINX run the commands below to stop and remove the container on **Lab Framework**
in your UDF deployment.

    ```bash
    docker rm -f {{petname}}-nginx-plus-fixit
    ```

1. From the NGINX One Console, in the left-hand menu in the *Manage* section, select *Instances*.

1. Wait until your instance transitions into the **Unavailable** state before proceeding. You may need to click The
*Refresh* button at the top right of the instance list.

1. Find your instance, select the *Actions* "..." context menu, and select *Delete*.

    > :warning: **Warning:** Make sure you are deleting your own instances and not someone elseâ€™s.

1. Select *Delete* to confirm.

## Conclusion

You have now completed the labs for the *Managing NGINX Instance using NGINX One Console* use case.

Proceed to the next lab where we will go through [Config Sync Groups](nginx-one-8.mdx).
